  title: Self-evaluation
  details: |
    Ever since I learned to read, I have known myself as a curious and self-taught person. I have a critical eye and recognize questions about logic, time, and resources. I believe that the balance of these issues fits perfectly with the wishes of the client and the owner/company.
    When I started my IT career, my momentum had an abrupt change, so I needed to earn more and fast; I migrated to another area where I could fulfill my need. While I was solving my own business, I was preparing myself so that in some time I could return to IT. I focused on English and on the friends that continued in IT career. I cultivate these friendships until today, they have been the ones that oriented me again in my life project.
    In these brief lines above, 11 years of much experience and intensity have gone by. I visited some Mercosur countries, different cultures, and peoples.
    And at the beginning of 2019, I was finally back on track, with a lot of study, effort, and satisfaction. Looking back on these two years, I realize that I learned a lot, and it's still "a bit" of what I can learn. The information is available. You just have to know how to take it.
